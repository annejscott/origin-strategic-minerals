# Origin of Strategic Minerals

### Author: AJ Strauman-Scott

## Introduction

In 2022, the U.S geological survey posted the 'final list of critical minerals'. This list outlines the fifty minerals most essential to the global economy and security.

This paper explores the political relationships between the United States and the countries with whom the nation is most dependent upon for critical minerals, with the intention to create a visualization to best communicate the current geopolitical situation as it relates to mineral mining, production and export.

## International Politics

The 50 critical minerals and their source countries were combined with a categorization of each country's international relationship with the US.

Countries were categorized as an 'ally', 'adversary' or 'neutral' based on U.S. Bilateral Relations Fact Sheets provided by the US Department of State. This paper made judgments on how to categorize each relationship based on descriptions in the overall description and 'Bilateral Economic Relations' section.

## Analysis

The importance of maintaining diplomatic relationships with China and Russia is the largest political issue facing critical mineral sourcing today. China produces greater than 35% of thirteen different critical minerals and Russia produces 40% of the world's palladium.

Political relationships are not the only issue in critical mineral sourcing. War, pandemic and natural disasters can also make mineral sources unstable. World Mining Data categorized the sources of each critical mineral as 'Stable', 'Fair', 'Unstable' and 'Extremely Unstable' based on the full circumstances - political, economic, social, natural - that help or hinder the production or mining of that mineral.

Twenty two of fifty critical minerals have more than 35% of their sources categorized as 'Unstable' or 'Extreme Unstable'.
